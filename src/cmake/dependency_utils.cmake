# checked_find_package(Pkgname ...) is a wrapper for find_package, with the
# following extra features:
#   * If either `USE_Pkgname` or the all-uppercase `USE_PKGNAME` (or
#     `ENABLE_Pkgname` or `ENABLE_PKGNAME`) exists as either a CMake or
#     environment variable, is nonempty by contains a non-true/nonzero
#     value, do not search for or use the package. The optional ENABLE <var>
#     arguments allow you to override the name of the enabling variable. In
#     other words, support for the dependency is presumed to be ON, unless
#     turned off explicitly from one of these sources.
#   * Print a message if the package is enabled but not found. This is based
#     on ${Pkgname}_FOUND or $PKGNAME_FOUND.
#   * Optional DEFINITIONS <string>... are passed to add_compile_definitions
#     if the package is found.
#   * Optional SETVARIABLES <id>... is a list of CMake variables to set to
#     TRUE if the package is found (they will not be set or changed if the
#     package is not found).
#   * Optional PRINT <list> is a list of variables that will be printed
#     if the package is found, if VERBOSE is on.
#   * Optional DEPS <list> is a list of hard dependencies; for each one, if
#     dep_FOUND is not true, disable this package with an error message.
#   * Optional ISDEPOF <downstream> names another package for which the
#     present package is only needed because it's a dependency, and
#     therefore if <downstream> is disabled, we don't bother with this
#     package either.
#   * Optional VERSION_MIN and VERSION_MAX, if supplied, give minimum and
#     maximum versions that will be accepted. The min is inclusive, the max
#     is exclusive (i.e., check for min <= version < max). Note that this is
#     not the same as providing a version number to find_package, which
#     checks compatibility, not minimum. Sometimes we really do just want to
#     say a minimum or a range. (N.B. When our minimum CMake >= 3.19, the
#     built-in way to do this is with version ranges passed to
#     find_package.)
#   * Optional RECOMMEND_MIN, if supplied, gives a minimum recommended
#     version, accepting but warning if it is below this number (even
#     if above the true minimum version accepted). The warning message
#     can give an optional explanation, passed as RECOMMEND_MIN_REASON.
#   * Optional CONFIG, if supplied, only accepts the package from an
#     exported config and never uses a FindPackage.cmake module.
#   * Optional PREFER_CONFIG, if supplied, tries to use an exported config
#     file from the package before using a FindPackage.cmake module.
#   * Optional DEBUG turns on extra debugging information related to how
#     this package is found.
#   * Found package "name version" or "name NONE" are accumulated in the list
#     CFP_ALL_BUILD_DEPS_FOUND. If the optional NO_RECORD_NOTFOUND is
#     supplied, un-found packags will not be recorded.
#   * Optional BUILD_LOCAL, if supplied, if followed by a token that specifies
#     the conditions under which to build the package locally by including a
#     script included in src/cmake/build_${pkgname}.cmake. If the condition is
#     "always", it will attempt to do so unconditionally. If "missing", it
#     will only do so if the package is not found. Also note that if the
#     global ${PROJECT_NAME}_BUILD_LOCAL_DEPS contains the package name or
#     is "all", it will behave as if set to "always", and if the variable
#     ${PROJECT_NAME}_BUILD_MISSING_DEPS contains the package name or is
#     "all", it will behave as if set to "missing".
#   * Optional NO_FP_RANGE_CHECK avoids passing the version range to
#     find_package itself.
#
# Explanation about local builds:
#
# If the package isn't found externally in the usual places or doesn't meet
# the version criteria, we check for the existance of a file at
# `src/build-scripts/build_<pkgname>.cmake`. If that exists, we include and
# execute it. The script can do whatever it wants, but should either (a)
# somehow set up the link targets that would have been found had the package
# had been found, or (b) set the variable `<pkgname>_REFIND` to a true value
# and have done something to ensure that the package will be found if we try a
# second time. For (b), typically that might mean downloading the package and
# building it locally, and then setting the `<pkgname>_ROOT` to where it's
# installed.
#
# N.B. This needs to be a macro, not a function, because the find modules
# will set(blah val PARENT_SCOPE) and we need that to be the global scope,
# not merely the scope for this function.

# Function: remove_prefixes_from_variable
# Removes specified directory prefixes from a given environment variable or CMake variable.
#
# Parameters:
#   VAR_TYPE  - Type of variable to modify:
#               'ENV'   for environment variables
#               'CMAKE' for CMake variables
#   VAR_NAME  - Name of the variable to modify.
#   PREFIXES  - List of directory prefixes to remove from the variable's value.
#
# Description:
#   This function updates the specified variable by removing any paths that start
#   with the given prefixes. It is useful for excluding certain directories
#   (e.g., Homebrew paths) from environment variables or CMake variables to prevent
#   unintended dependencies during the build process.
#
# Usage Example:
#   remove_prefixes_from_variable(ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH "/opt/homebrew" "/usr/local")
#   remove_prefixes_from_variable(CMAKE CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "${HOMEBREW_PREFIXES}")

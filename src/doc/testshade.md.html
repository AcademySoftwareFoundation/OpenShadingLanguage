_testshade_ basics
==================================================

The OSL software distribution inculdes `testshade`, a command-line utility
that was written for OSL unit tests, and for a "test harness" in which we
can execute shaders for debugging (the shaders or OSL itself) in isolation
from any particular rendering system.

But testshade is very flexible, and in addition to testing the OSL library
itself, it has a number of potential uses in a production studio, including:

* Unit testing production shaders (particularly "utility" shader nodes)
  without the overhead of a full render or the trouble of constructing a
  full scene.

* Providing a "test harness" for debugging shaders (or the OSL)

* Baking procedural patterns into textures.

* Benchmarking shaders and evaluating their performance, including
  comparitive tests such as "is it faster to code it this way or that way?"

* Exploring the inner workings of OSL's runtime optimizer, to answer
  questions like: "will this idiom optimize away at runtime when I use
  the default parameter values?"



## Running a shader once

Let's run testshade on a simple shader.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
shader hello (float a = 0, float b = 1)
{
    printf ("hello, a+b = %g\n", a+b);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compile your shader as usual:

```
$ oslc hello.osl
Compiled hello.osl -> hello.oso
```

Now run the shader in the `testshade` harness:

```shell
$ testshade hello
hello, a+b = 1
```



## Setting parameters

You can set the value of shaders parameters (that is, per-material
_instance value_ overrides of the default values of parameters) using

   `--param` *name* *value*

prior to the name of the shader to load.  For example,

```shell
$ testshade --param a 3.14 --param b 5.0 hello
hello, a+b = 8.14
```

The type of data you pass will be inferred from the formatting of the
value you pass:

 Formatting                 | OSL type | Example
 ---------------------------|----------|--------
 single whole number        | `int`    | `42`
 single number with decimal | `float`  | `42.0`
 three comma-separated numbers (no spaces) | `color`, `point`, `vector`, or `normal` | `0.6,0.35,0.99`
 16 comma-separated numbers (no spaces) | `matrix` | `1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1`
 anything else              | `string` | `"Now is the time..."`


Be careful to match the types of your parameters correctly, or you will see
an error like this (note that we pass the value of `b` as `5` rather than
`5.0`):

```shell
$ testshade --param a 3.14 --param b 5 hello
WARNING: attempting to set parameter with wrong type: b (expected 'float', received 'int')
hello, a+b = 4.14
```

However, for other types, or to resolve ambiguities (for example if you want
three numbers passed as `float[3]` rather than `vector`, or you want to pass
the *string* `"1"` instead of an integer), you can explicitly specify the
type using an optional modifier `--param:type=`*mytype*, like this:

```shell
$ testshade --param:type=color c 0,0,0 --param:type=string s "1" testshader
```

## Saving outputs to images

Most shaders that aren't trying to be unit tests don't have `printf()`
calls to show you their output. And you probably want to see what they do
for varying inputs. Let us consider a more typical shader
with real outputs and spatially-varying behavior:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
shader show_uv (output color out = 0)
{
    out = color (u, v, 0);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

![`uv.jpg`](Figures/testshade/show_uv.jpg)
```
$ oslc show_uv.osl
Compiled show_uv.osl -> show_uv.oso

$ testshade -g 100 100 show_uv -o out uv.jpg
Output out to uv.jpg
```

Helpful command line arguments:

`-g` *xres yres*
:   Specifies the resolution of the "grid" to shade.  For example, `-g 512 256`
    will shade 512 horizontal samples by 256 vertical samples. The default
    is 1x1, shading only one location.

`-o` *variable* *filename*
: Specifies that *variable* (which must be a shader `output` parameter)
  should be saved.

  It is important to be aware that you may have *multiple* `-o` commands,
  and each may output a different `output` variable of the shader to
  different files.

`-d` *datatype*
: By default, image files will generally save `float` data. But the `-od`
  command can let you select an alternative pixel data format. For example,

  `testshade -g 100 100 show_uv -od uint8 out.tif`

  will ensure that the `out.tif` file is written with 8 bit integer pixels.

`--print`
: This override causes the `-o` outputs to print their values to the console
  rather than save images. This is not very useful except when shading very
  small grids.

`--offsetuv` *uoffset voffset* `--scaleuv` *uscale vscale*
: Controls the range of the `u` and `v` surface parameters over the shading
  grid, which defaults to the leftmost column having `u=0` and rightmost
  column uaving `u=1`, and the top scanline having `v=0` and the bottom
  scanline having `v=1`.

  As an example, to make the uv range go from 0-2 rather than 0-1, you
  can:

  `testshade -g 100 100 show_uv -scaleuv 2 2 -od uint8 out.tif`



## Specifying shader networks

For the sake of simplicity, this document presents almost all examples as if
they consisted of just a single shader node. But `testshade` is able to
specify and execut entire shader groups (networks of shader nodes). The
remainder of this section will explain how this can be done.

Let's make a simple shader network as an example.

We have the following shaders:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
shader texturemap (string texturename = "", output color out = 0)
{
    out = texture (texturename, u, v);
}

shader contrast (color in = 0, color mid = 0.5, color scale = 1,
                 output color out = 0)
{
    color val = in - mid;
    val *= scale;
    out = val + mid;
}

shader noisy (point position = P, float frequency = 1,
              output color out = 0)
{
    point p = position * frequency;
    color fBm =        (color) snoise(p)
              + 0.5  * (color) snoise(p*2)
              + 0.25 * (color) snoise(p*4);
    out = 0.5 + 0.5*fBm;
}

shader umixer (color left = 0, color right = 0, output color out = 0)
{
    out = mix (left, right, smoothstep (0, 1, u));
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And we wish to construct the following shader group:

*******************************************************************
*
*  .------------.out     in.----------.out
*  | texturemap +--------->| contrast +---.
*  '------------'          '----------'    \ left .--------.out
*                                           '---->| umixer +--->
*                                   .------------>|        |
*       .------------.out          /        right '--------'
*       |   noisy    +------------'
*       '------------'
*
*******************************************************************


### Simple networks on the command line: Using `--layer` and `--connect`

For relatively simple networks, we can simply specify them in full
on the `testshade` command line, using the following commands:

`--param` *name* *value*
: As you know, `--param` sets the value of a parameter by name. But
  specifically, it sets a parameter, *of the next declared shader*.  Thus,
  you may intersperse `--param` and named shaders and set parameters
  separately for each of them:

      `testshade -param a 1 -param b 2 shader1 -param c 0 shader2`

  This example sets parameters `a` and `b` of *shader1* and parameter `c`
  of *shader2*.

`--shader` *shadername* *layername*
: Creates a new shader node of the kind of shader named by *shadername*,
  and binds any pending `--param` settings to that shader node. The shader
  node is assigned the label *layername*, which may be used with any
  `--connect` directives later in the command line.

`--connect` *layer1 param1 layer2 param2*
: Establishes a connection from shader *layer1*'s output parameter *param1*
  to shader *layer2*'s input parameter *param2*. Both *layer1* and *layer2*
  must be layer names bestowed via `--shader` on shaders declared earlier on
  the command line, and *layer1* must have been declared prior to *layer2*.

So the following would be the command lineto declare the shader network
described above:

![noisetex network](Figures/testshade/noisetex.jpg width="180px")
```shell
$ testshade -param texturename "grid.tx" \
            -shader texturemap tex1 \
            -param frequency 4.0 \
            -shader noisy noise1 \
            -param scale 1.0 \
            -shader contrast cont1 \
            -shader umixer mix1 \
            -connect tex1 out cont1 in \
            -connect cont1 out mix1 left \
            -connect noise1 out mix1 right \
            -g 256 256 -o out noisetex.jpg
```


### Complex networks: deserializing with `--group`

For very complex networks, it is unweildy to specify a large number of
`-layer`, `-param`, and `-connect` directives on the command line. But OSL
supports serialization of shader group declarations. Please refer to the
*OSL Language Specification* for details, in the chapter titled "Describing
shader groups."

`--group` *groupspec*
: Specify an entire shader network using OSL's serialized shader group
  notation. The *groupspec* may be either the whole thing inline, or the
  name of a file containing the serialization.

The serialization corresponding to the shader group that we've used in
this section is:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
param string texturename "grid.tx" ;
shader texturemap tex1 ;
param float frequency 4.0 ;
shader noisy noise1 ;
param float scale 1.0 ;
shader contrast cont1 ;
shader umixer mix1 ;
connect tex1.out cont1.in ;
connect cont1.out mix1.left ;
connect noise1.out mix1.right ;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[`noisetex.shadergroup`:]

And so the equivalent command is:

```shell
$ testshade -group noisetex.shadergroup -g 256 256 -o out noisetex.jpg
```



Shading unit testing with _testshade_
==================================================

You can use `testshade` to run quick tests to verify the behavior of your
shaders (particular utility shaders), for example as part of a testsuite.
Using `testshade` can be much more convenient than testing your shaders in a
renderer -- you can easily run it on one or a few points, it will execute
very quickly, you do not need to build a "scene" or invoke the whole
renderer, and it may be much more straightforward to run test cases
involving specific values.

Let's construct a concrete example.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~C
shader clamped_mix (color in1=0, color in2=0, float mask = 0,
                    output color out = 0)
{
    out = mix (in1, in2, clamp(0, 1, mask));
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we go off and think deep thoughts about this shader, and come up with
several test cases:
* mask=0, should return in1
* mask=1, should return in2
* mask=0.5, should return the average
* verify that mask < 0 clamps to in1
* verify that mask > 1 clamps to in2

So our unit test script might look like this:

```shell
testshade -print -param in1 1,2,3 -param in2 4,5,6 -param mask 0.0 clamped_mix -o out out.exr
testshade -print -param in1 1,2,3 -param in2 4,5,6 -param mask 1.0 clamped_mix -o out out.exr
testshade -print -param in1 1,2,3 -param in2 4,5,6 -param mask 0.5 clamped_mix -o out out.exr
testshade -print -param in1 1,2,3 -param in2 4,5,6 -param mask -1.0 clamped_mix -o out out.exr
testshade -print -param in1 1,2,3 -param in2 4,5,6 -param mask 2.0 clamped_mix -o out out.exr
```

Resulting in the following output:

```shell
Output out to out.exr
Pixel (0, 0):
  out : 4 5 6
Output out to out.exr
Pixel (0, 0):
  out : 4 5 6
Output out to out.exr
Pixel (0, 0):
  out : 4 5 6
Output out to out.exr
Pixel (0, 0):
  out : 4 5 6
Output out to out.exr
Pixel (0, 0):
  out : 4 5 6
```

Wait a minute... **that's not right at all!**

Good thing we unit-tested this shader. Do you see the bug? We wrote
the arguments to `clamp()` in the wrong order. Here is the correct shader:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~C
shader clamped_mix (color in1=0, color in2=0, float mask = 0,
                    output color out = 0)
{
    out = mix (in1, in2, clamp(mask, 0, 1));
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And the new output from our tests is:

```shell
Output out to out.exr
Pixel (0, 0):
  out : 1 2 3
Output out to out.exr
Pixel (0, 0):
  out : 4 5 6
Output out to out.exr
Pixel (0, 0):
  out : 2.5 3.5 4.5
Output out to out.exr
Pixel (0, 0):
  out : 1 2 3
Output out to out.exr
Pixel (0, 0):
  out : 4 5 6
```

That's better. Unit tests are great!

We can also debug visual patterns. Let's look at a shader that computes
fractional Brownian motion:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~C
shader fBm (point position = P, int octaves = 4, float lacunarity = 2,
            float gain = 0.5, float offset = 0.5,
            float amplitude = 0.5, float frequency = 1,
            output float out = 0)
{
    point p = position * frequency;
    float amp = amplitude;
    float sum = offset;
    for (int i = 0;  i < octaves;  i += 1) {
        sum += amp * snoise (p);
        amp *= gain;
        p *= lacunarity;
    }
    out = sum;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We might want to construct a number of unit tests to ensure that each
parameter produces the visual control we expect:

```shell
SETUP="-g 100 100 --scaleuv 4 4"
testshade $SETUP fbm -o out fBm_default.jpg
testshade $SETUP -param octaves 2 fbm -o out fBm_octaves.jpg
testshade $SETUP -param lacunarity 4.0 fbm -o out fBm_lac.jpg
testshade $SETUP -param gain 0.75 fbm -o out fBm_gain.jpg
testshade $SETUP -param frequency 0.25 fbm -o out fBm_freq.jpg
```

![frequency=0.25](Figures/testshade/fBm_freq.jpg)
![gain=0.75](Figures/testshade/fBm_gain.jpg)
![lacunarity=4](Figures/testshade/fBm_lac.jpg)
![octaves=2](Figures/testshade/fBm_octaves.jpg)
![default](Figures/testshade/fBm_default.jpg)



Procedural texture baking
==================================================

The previous example of unit-testing the fBm pattern might make you wonder:
If I have an expensive procedural pattern, can I use testshade to "bake" it
into a texture, and then at runtime I can just do a single texture lookup as
a simpler and less expensive alternative than evaluating the procedural
pattern? And as a bonus, the texture lookup will be automatically
antialiased, whereas a procedural pattern often requires great care to
analytically antialias.

And we are, indeed, very close to that working. It really only needs the
addition of a single command to change the behavior of the sample
placement.

## Evaluating like a texture, rather than like a geometric grid

When we use `-g` *x y* to set the resolution of the evaluation grid, by
default the `u` and `v` values are set up as if we are evaluating a
geometric mesh, with the first and last samples exactly on the uv
boundaries.

In concrete terms `testshade -g 2 2` will do 4 shader evaluations with u,v
coordinates at (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1).

This is great for unit testing because you probably want, very specifically,
to be able to inspect what happens right at those extreme values. But it
doesn't correspond to the locations of the pixel centers of a 2x2 image.

`--center`
: Adjust the `u` and `v` values to be at *pixel centers* as if the grid
  truly represented a texture and you want to evaluate the pattern at the
  exact center of each pixel.

If you `testshade -g 2 2 --center`, the 4 shader evaluations will have u,v
coordinates of (0.25,0.25), (0.75,0.25), (0.75,0.25), and (0.75,0.75), which
are the normalized image space (or texture space) coordinates of the centers
of each of the 2x2 pixels in a texture.

So, here's an example of converting OSL's `pnoise` (periodic noise) function
call into a texture:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~C
shader makenoise (float frequency = 32,
                  output float out = 0)
{
    out = pnoise (u*frequency, v*frequency,
                  frequency, frequency);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

![noise.tx](Figures/testshade/makenoise.jpg width="128px")
```shell
$ testshade -g 1024 1024 --center makenoise -o out noise.exr
$ maketx noise.exr -wrap periodic -d uint8 -o noise.tx
```

## Baking simple expressions

For *short* shaders that are really just evaluating a single expression
(basically, one-liners like `makenoise` above), there's a simple way to have
`testshade` create an image that evaluates the expression without saving the
OSL source to a file, compiling it, and running it as separate steps.

`--expr "`*expression*`"`
: Simply evaluate a code expression that assigns to a variable called
  `result` (which is a `color`), for each point being shaded.

Example:

```shell
$ testshade -g 1024 1024 -center \
    -expr "result = (float)pnoise(u*32,v*32,32,32);" -o result noise.exr
```


Benchmarking shaders
==================================================

## Basic shader benchmarking

Here are some more command line options that are helpful for benchmarking:

`--iters` *n*
: Runs the whole grid of shaders $n$ times. This is useful when, even with
  a large grid, you want the benchmark to run longer, to get more accurate
  times.

`-t` *threads*
: Controls the number of threads used. The default is automatically detected
  based on your hardware profile. But when benchmarking, it may be helpful
  to have explicit control over the number of threads.


## Example: Which is more expensive, fBm or texture?

```shell
$ time testshade -center -g 1024 1024 -t 1 -iters 100 fBm -o out fBm.tif
real    0m20.492s


$ time testshade -center -g 1024 1024 -t 1 -iters 100 \
    -expr "result = (float)texture (\"fBm.tx\",u,v);" -o result fBm-tex.tif
real    0m32.663s
```

Also, we can measure the "overhead" of testshade (all the iterating, setup
of the shades and retrieval of outputs, output of image, etc.) by running a
trivial shader the same number of iterations:

```shell
$ time testshade -center -g 1024 1024 -t 1 -iters 100 \
    -expr "result = 0;" -o result null.tif
real    0m6.429s
```

Computing the default of 4 octaves of noise is $(20.5-6.4)/(32.7-6.4) =
53\%$ of the speed of a single texture lookup. So baking that pattern to
texture would not be a wise optimization.

But if we needed to compute 8 octaves of noise in our fBm loop...

```shell
$ time testshade -center -g 1024 1024 -t 1 -iters 100 \
    -param octaves 8 fBm -o out fBm.tif
real    0m34.532s
```

So computing at least 8 octaves of noise is definitely more expensive than a
single texture lookup.



## Controling optimization

You can control the optimization level overall:

`-O0 -O1 -O2`
: Sets runtime optimization level. The default is 2, which means to do
  all reasonable optimizations (just like in production). Sometimes it is
  helpful to set a lower level of optimization (`-O1`) or turn off almost
  all runtime optimizations (`-O0`) in order to either understand exactly
  how much the optimizations change performance, or to rule out any
  suspected bugs in the optimizer if you are witnessing weird behavior.


## Lockgeom parameters

Remember that one of the most important runtime optimizations that OSL
performs is to take any parameters whose values are known at that time and
turn them into constants, with known values that can be propagated to all
the computations that involve that parameter.

So if you are benchmarking a shader which in typical production use will
have a parameter that is usually connected to an output of an upstream
shader that computes something spatially-varying (and therefore not able to
turn into a constant), it is important for your benchmarks to understand
shader performance under that condition, and not be misled by allowing the
parameter to be optimized away.

Recall that OSL's runtime assumes that parameters are not by default able to
be overridden by interpolated per-geometric-primitive data (in OSL lingo, we
say its value is "locked from modification by the geometry", or
`lockgeom=1`). The alternative override, `lockgeom=0`, means that
interpolated the value may vary from object to object, or across each
object, if a similarly named geometric variable is available on the object.

Now, this is not exactly the same situation -- lockgeom versus a spatially-
varying value from an earlier layer. But nonetheless, declaring a parameter
as `lockgeom=0` has the effect we want for this purpose, which is to prevent
the runtime optimizer from assuming that the parameter's value is a known
constant. This is easily achieved via an optional modifier to the `--param`
command line argument:

`--param:lockgeom=0` *name* *value*
: Declares the parameter and its value, and marks it as `lockgeom=0`, and
  thus prevents the runtime optimizer from assuming a known constant value
  for the parameter. Note that you can combine this with the other optional
  modifier, `:type=`, by simply appending: `--param:type=color:lockgeom=0`

There is not an automatic way to handle this situation. Only you, human,
know which shader parameters are highly likely to be connected to non-
constant values from earlier layers (or indeed supplied as interpolated
values on the objects) when used in real production material networks. It's
up to you to tell `testshade` which parameters fall into this situation so
that they are not optimized away so as to lead you to an inaccurate
reflection of what optimizations would really happen at render time. At the
same time, be careful not to inadvertently set `lockgeom=0` for parameters
that will typically be set to default values, instance values, or
connections from layers that are likely to be analized and found to emit
constants for theor outputs -- you also don't want your benchmarks to
incorrectly disable optimizations what would typically happen at render
time.

## Full Statistics Log

Here are some additional runtime options that are helpful

`--runstats`
: Prints the full OSL shading system statistics, and also if your shaders access
  any texture, the full OpenImageIO texture system statistics.

Here's an example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~shell
$ testshade -t 1 --runstats -group noisetex.shadergroup -g 1024 1024  -o out noisetex.jpg

Exploring OSL runtime optimization
==================================================

`--debug --debug2`
: `--debug` will show you the corresponding "oso" (essentially OSL's
  assembly language for its virtual machine execution model) of each
  shader in the network before, and after, the runtime optimization step.

  `--debug2` also tries to print status messages explaining every
  optimization performed.

Let's use a small shader network consisting of a texture lookup node,
connected to a contrast adjustment node, and run it with `--debug`:

```shell
$ testshade -debug -param texturename "grid.tx" -shader texturemap tex1 \
            -shader contrast cont1 -connect tex1 out cont1 in \
            -g 256 256 -o out out.jpg
```

In addition to seeing the timing and end statistics like you so with
`--runstats` (to reduce clutter, those parts will not be reproduced in the
output example below), you will see the code pre- and post-optimization:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you pay particular attention to the "layer 1" information, you'll see
that it started off comprising the following operations:

```
    0: sub val in mid   #   BBLOCK-START  (contrast.osl:4)
    1: mul val val scale    #   (contrast.osl:5)
    2: add out val mid  #   (contrast.osl:6)
    3: end  #   CONST  (contrast.osl:6)
```

and then after optimizations, it was reduced to:

```shell
    0: useparam in  #   BBLOCK-START  (contrast.osl:6)
    1: assign out in    #   (contrast.osl:6)
    2: end  #   CONST  (contrast.osl:6)
```

That is, the math all constant-folded away, and all that was left was
copying input `in` to output `out`.

You can get even more information about what's happening if you use the
`--debug2` option. In addition to the previous debug output, the debug level
2 output will try include messages explaining exactly what sequence of code
simplification steps occurred and why. For example, buried in the output
you will see:

```shell
...
layer 1 "cont1", pass 0:
op 1 turned 'mul val val $newconst3' to 'assign val val' : A * 1 => A (@ contrast.osl:5)
op 1 turned 'assign val val' to 'nop' : self-assignment (@ contrast.osl:5)
layer 1 "cont1", pass 1:
op 2 turned 'add out val $newconst2' to 'assign out in' : simplify add/sub pair (@ contrast.osl:6)
op 0 turned 'sub val in $newconst2' to 'nop' : simplify add/sub pair (@ contrast.osl:4)
layer 1 "cont1", pass 2:
...
```


Why would you want this?

One of the strengths of OSL is that you can write a shader with lots of
options and parameters, which if left in their unused/default state, will
optimize away completely and truly have no runtime execution penalty.

But sometimes you want to be extra sure that the functionality you are
adding will indeed be optimized away. Using the debug options gives you a
way to verify that OSL runtime optimization is simplifying your shaders in
the manner you expect.

Conclusion
==================================================

Using the `testshade` utility that was designed for OSL's internal unit
tests, you can:

* Create fast unit tests for your shader node library to verify their
  correct operation with input test cases, independent of any renderer.

* Test shader nodes or entire shader networks (at least for patterns that
  make sense rendered and imaged on a 2D plane), to view it directly or
  compare to reference imagery to test correctness or for bugs/regressions.

* Generate image swatches for shaders, useful for documentation.

* "Bake" procedural patterns into texture maps.

* Benchmark shaders to ensure that there is no performance regression, to
  compare different hardware platforms, to compare versions of OSL against
  each other for performance improvement.

* Benchmark different shader coding approaches against each other to know
  what shader idioms execute faster or slower.

* Understand deeply what runtime optimizations are being performed by OSL.

* Verify that your shaders are optimizing in ways that you expect, such as
  ensuring that unused/default parameters get optimized away and have no
  runtime cost when executing the shader.

* Test a suspected buggy shader (or buggy shading system!) independent of
  any renderer, to verify that it works properly.

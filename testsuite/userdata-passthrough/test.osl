// This is testing the specific combination of an output parameter (which
// is presumed to be a renderer output or otherwise definitely used) which
// gets its value from userdata (lockgeom=0).
//
// Cd is what we call a "pass-through" value: its initial value is from an
// input, it gets modified, but it's also an output.
//
// Here's the interesting bug, prior to 1.12: If scale is non-1, all is
// fine, the output will be scale*input_Cd. But when scale is exactly 1.0,
// the `Cd *= scale` will be optimized away, leaving no ops in the shader
// that read Cd, and therefore get_userdata will never be called to retrieve
// the value, and so the output value of Cd will be its default here, 0. But
// in fact, it should still hold whatever value it has from teh userdata.


shader test (float scale = 1,
             output vector Cd = 0 [[ int lockgeom=0 ]]
    )
{
    Cd *= scale;
}

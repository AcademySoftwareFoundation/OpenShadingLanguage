# Documentation

The OSL Documentation Project is a work in progress.

The plan is to adopt the OCIO Documentation Project's methodology for maintaining and building documentation of various kinds as it becomes the blueprint for the ASWF.

There is much work to be done here. 

Of particular interest are these topics. Please consider adding any information you might have about any of these to the repo:

* Any material at all for people learning to write OSL shaders (beyond the formal language spec, which is not intended to be a tutorial or cookbook for writing shaders).
* Example .osl code and/or .h files that are:
    1. Generally useful, but do not warrant inclusion into the OSL source itself.
    2. Tutorial in nature.
* Robust installation or build instructions for Windows and macOS.
* Guide for how to integrate OSL into an application such as a renderer.

If you have some relevant content and you'd like to discuss its inclusion, please use the OSL Documentation discussion:

or alternatively, you may post to:

You may also simply submit a PR.

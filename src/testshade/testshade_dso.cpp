    // passing RTLD_GLOBAL as the mode, and that plugin accesses OSL (by
    // linking against liboslexec), it turns out that LLVM can fail in
    // finding symbols when it does its dlsym to resolve functions in
    // the app called by the IR.  Since we can't control the app
    // (Houdini and Maya, I'm talking to you!), we compensate by asking
    // to dlopen it here, the "right" way, and then later on, LLVM will
    // be able to find the symbols.  I haven't can't seem to reproduce
    // this issue on OS X, so for now we only do this on Linux.

    // This would not be necessary if we didn't specifically disallow
    // RTLD_GLOBAL in the Plugin::open call below, but we are purposely
    // disallowing global symbol visibility in order to test this
    // solution.

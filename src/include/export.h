/// \file
/// DLLPUBLIC and DLLEXPORT macros that are necessary for proper symbol
/// export when doing multi-platform development.


///
/// On Windows, when compiling code that will end up in a DLL, symbols
/// must be marked as 'exported' (i.e. __declspec(dllexport)) or they
/// won't be visible to programs linking against the DLL.
///
/// In addition, when compiling the application code that calls the DLL,
/// if a routine is marked as 'imported' (i.e. __declspec(dllimport)),
/// the compiler can be smart about eliminating a level of calling
/// indirection.  But you DON'T want to use __declspec(dllimport) when
/// calling a function from within its own DLL (it will still compile
/// correctly, just not with maximal efficiency).  Which is quite the
/// dilemma since the same header file is used by both the library and
/// its clients.  Sheesh!
///
/// We solve this awful mess by defining these macros:
///
/// DLLPUBLIC - normally, assumes that it's being seen by a client
///             of the library, and therefore declare as 'imported'.
///             But if DLL_EXPORT_PUBLIC is defined, change the declaration
///             to 'exported' -- you want to define this macro when
///             compiling the module that actually defines the class.
///
/// DLLEXPORT - tag a symbol as exported from its DLL and therefore
///             visible from any app that links against the DLL.  Do this
///             only if you don't need to call the routine from within
///             a different compilation module within the same DLL.  Or,
///             if you just don't want to worry about the whole
///             DLL_EXPORT_PUBLIC mess, and use this everywhere without
///             fretting about the minor perf hit of not using 'import'.
///
/// Note that on Linux, all symbols are exported so this just isn't a
/// problem, so we define these macros to be nothing.
///
/// It's a shame that we have to clutter all our header files with these
/// stupid macros just because the Windows world is such a mess.

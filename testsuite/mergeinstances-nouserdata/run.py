# This test is specifically to test the opt_merge_instances_with_userdata
# option. If working correctly when set to zero, the a1 and a2 layers should
# NOT merge, and thus you will see two printf output line from "a".
# On the other hand, a single "a" printf means that the a1 and a2 layers
# merged, which is the correct default but should not happen when you
# set opt_merge_instances_with_userdata=0.

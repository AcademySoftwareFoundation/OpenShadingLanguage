# This test verifies the execution order for both the default lazy
# execution, and the explicit entry points.
#
# The group looks like this:
#
#     layer A   (sets global Ci, no connections)
#
#
#     layer B   (connected downstream to E)
#   ____|
#  |
#  |  layer C   (no connections)
#  |
#  |
#  |  layer D   (no connections, but sets a renderer output)
#  |    |____>
#  |
#  +----+
#       V
#     layer E   (connected upstream to B, downstream to F and G)
#  +----|
#  |    V
#  |  layer F   (connected upstream to E)
#  |
#  +----v
#     layer G   (connected upstream to E, and it's the last layer)
#
#
# So by the default execution rules, the execution sequence will be:
#   A   (because it sets a global) [presuming lazyglobls == 0]
#   D   (because it sets a renderer output)
#   G   (because it's the last layer -- presumed group entry point)
#   E   (because F pulls its output)
#   B   (because E pulls its output)
#
# But if we give explicit entry points and ask to execute layers B, F, E,
# then the call sequence will be:
#   B   (because we ask for it)
#   F   (because we ask for it)
#         (note: then B does NOT get called gain, because it already ran)
#   E   (because F asks for it)
#   (then we should see F end)
#   (then E does NOT get called again, because it already ran)
#
# Finally, if we merely ask it to run whatever layer is necessary for
# output E.out, then we should see:
#   E   (because that's what makes E.out)
#   B   (because E pulls its output)

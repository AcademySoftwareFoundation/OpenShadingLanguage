// Versions.  There are three different sets of version numbers:
// (a) The version of the OSL language specification itself, i.e.,
//     what is OSL syntax, semantics, and standard library.
// (b) The version of the OSL library, i.e., this very software whose
//     source code you are reading.
// (c) The version of the .oso file format that this library uses
//     for compiled shaders.
// These are all independent, though loosely coupled.

// Version of the language:

// Version numbers for the compiled shader format.  The major number

// work with current versions of the library (this should be EXTREMELY
// rare, hopefully never).  The minor number may be changed if newly
// compiled shaders won't work for old libraries, which sometimes
// happens but still should not be often.  Adding a new hint or a new
// shader instruction is not considered a change to the file format!

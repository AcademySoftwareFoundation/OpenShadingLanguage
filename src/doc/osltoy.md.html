_osltoy_ basics
==================================================

`osltoy` is an interactive editor and realtime visualizer for OSL shaders.
It is inspired by [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) by Inigo Quilez.
But it uses a real VFX shading language!

The basic functionaity of `osltoy` is:

* Allow you to edit OSL shader source code.
* Live and continuous rendering of an "image" that is the result of running
  your shader on each pixel of the image (pixel color is taken from the
  shader's parameter `output color Cout`.)


## Command line

Launch `osltoy` from the command line:

`osltoy` [*options*]

Additional command line arguments:

`--help`
:   Print command line options and other help.

`-v`
: Verbose mode. (Doesn't really do anything currently.)

`--res` *xres* *yres* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
: Specifies the resolution of the render window (default: 512 x 512).

`--threads` *n*
: Specifies the number of simultaneous threads to use for shading. If not
  specified, it will use all your hardware cores.

*filename.osl*
: If one or more filenames of shader source code are specified, they will
  be loaded into editor tabs upon startup.


## osltoy Basics

First, let's launch `osltoy`:

```
$ osltoy
```

![ ](Figures/osltoy/osltoy-start.jpg  width="400px")
This will start up a new `osltoy` session.
On the right half of the GUI is a code editor window. Below the code editor
is an area that will show you any compilation errors. The left half of the
GUI will display the results of the shader (a checkerboard if no shader
has been compiled yet). Below that is an area that will hold widgets to
allow adjustment of shader parameter values.

At the very bottom of the app window is a status bar showing time, frames
per second, and other status messages. At the very top of the app window
(or, on MacOS, at the top of the screen) is a menu bar with the usual set of
common operations.

### Loading and saving shaders

You can load a shader one of three ways:

1. Specify the filename of an existing shader when you launch the app:
   ```
   osltoy test.osl
   ```

2. From a blank window, load an existing shader by selecting the menu
   bar choice `File` --> `Open`, or hitting the hotkey `Ctrl-O` (on MacOS,
   ⌘`-O`). This will present a file selection dialog.

3. Just start typing in the editor window.

You can save the edited shader with the menu bar `File` --> `Save`
or the hotkey `Ctrl-S` (⌘`-S` on MacOS). If the file does not yet
have a name, you will be presented with a file save dialog (as you will
if you use `File` --> `Save As`).

!!! Note
    Every time we talk about a `Ctrl-`*key* combination, if you are on MacOS
    (OSX), that hotkey will be ⌘`-`*key*. This document won't awkwardly
    repeat this clarification for every command.

### Compiling shaders

When you have loaded or edited your OSL source code, you can compile the
shader with menu `Tools` --> `Recompile shaders`, or by clicking the
`Recompile` button below the source code editor widget, or by using the
hotkey `Ctrl-R`.

!!! Warning
    `osltoy` won't compile a buffer that doesn't have a filename ending in
    `.osl`, and if you started with a blank window, it won't have a name at
    all until you save the first time.

In the compilation status window below the editor, you will either see
an `Ok` message if the compiler succeeded, or the error output from the
compiler, as illustrated here:

![Compilation error display.](Figures/osltoy/osltoy-error.jpg  width="512px")


!!! Warning
    `osltoy` appears to let you load or create multiple shaders, appearing
    in a tabbed editor. We'll get this working eventually (so you can edit
    whole shader groups and all the shaders that are in them), but currently
    only the shader in the first tab will be compiled and executed, so don't
    get confused by the non-functional parts of the interface.


### Executing shaders and interactive changes

Once you compile the shader successfully, it will execute and display the
results of shading a rectangle.

![osltoy has executed the shader](Figures/osltoy/osltoy-fbm.jpg)

As soon as you recompile, the shader will be executed as quickly as possible
and displayed as an image on the left, with shader parameter adjustment
widgets below it.

Evey time you change a parameter value through its widget, the shader will
automatically recompile and re-execute. If you edit the text of the shader,
clicking the `Recompile` button or using the hotkey `Ctrl-R` will recompile
and re-execute the shader.


Rules of the game
==================

## Shader inputs and state

The shader is executed on every pixel of an image (defaulting to a 512x512
square, but you can change the resolution via a command line flag).

The `float u` and `v` global variables vary from 0 to 1 along the rectangle.

The `point P` global variable will be set to `(x,y,0)`, where `x` is the pixel
horizontal coordinate (0 to xres-1 as it goes from left to right) and `y`
is the pixel vertical coordinate (0 to yres-1 as it goes from top to bottom
of the image).

The `float time` global variable contains the time (in seconds) since the
last time the shader was recompiled. Making your shader change its behavior
based on the `time` variable will make an animated shader.

## Shader outputs

The color displayed is taken from the shader output parameter that is
declared like this:

```
    output color Cout = 0
```

Whatever you place in that output will be the color displayed at each pixel
of the output image.

!!! Note
    Your shader does not need to set `Ci` or deal with closures. The
    `osltoy` app is just for exploring pattern generation, not illumination.
    It doesn't actually have any notion of 3D geometry or lights.


## Shader execution

If your shader does not reference the `time` variable in any way, it will
only be executed once each time it recompiles. But if `time` appears in your
shader, it will execute repeatedly, as quickly as possible, until you exit
or recompile.

Shader execution will by default use enough threads to keep all your cores
busy. The command line option `--threads` can be used to limit the number
of cores (or to "over-thread").


Caveats, limitations, and broken stuff
========================

These are current limitations or breakages that we will fix over time.

* The GUI seems to let you open multiple editor tabs, but currently, the
  only one that will compile and execute is the *first* (farthest to the left
  tab that was loaded or saved under a name that ends in `".osl"`.

* We intend to add "Pause" and "Reset" buttons to control time.

* I tried to make the parameter adjustment widgets be clever about how
  quickly to modify the values, depending on their range. But I don't have
  it quite right. It's still being refined.

* There isn't yet have a way to get the shader itself to get information about
  external events such as mouse clicks or key presses, but that would be
  fun.

* There isn't yet a way for the shader to have *state* that can be computed,
  stored, then re-read when the shader executes on the next frame.


Things to try
=============

* Try this:

  `  osltoy ` *osl_install_directory*`/shaders/mandelbrot.osl`

* Use the global `time` variable to make animated patterns.

* Explore noise functions and other pattern generation interactively.

* Explore (by keeping an eye on the "FPS" reading at the bottom) what shader
  operations are fast and what is slow.

* Don't forget that `texture()` calls work as expected in shadertoy!

* `osltoy` is a great tool for leaning or *teaching* OSL.

* The actual "geometry" is just a rectangle, but like with Shadertoy,
  you can make patterns that *look like* by implementing a simple ray tracer
  in the shader itself, or using other clever tricks.

* Look at the many examples on [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/)
  for inspiration!

* Make crazy stuff and post the shaders to the `osl-dev` mail list!

// This is a regression test for a weird case where we have a parameter (B)
// that by default is initialized to the value of A (i.e. it has init ops),
// but if it is given instance value 0.0, the bug was that it would revert to
// thinking its true value was 0.0 and forget about the init ops entirely.


shader test (float A = 0.5,
             float B = A)
{
    printf("A = %g, B = %g\n", A, B);

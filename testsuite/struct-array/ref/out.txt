test arrays of struct

float f; f = a[2].f;  ==> 15
float g = a[2].f;  ==> 15
test struct containing array of struct:
b.a[1].f == 3.14159
test struct assignment to and from one array element:
after c=a[2], c = { 15, 1 1 1 }
after a[3]=c, a[3] = { 15, 1 1 1 }
test array-of-struct assignmment:
a2 = a; float f2; f = a2[2].f;  ==> 15 (should be 15)

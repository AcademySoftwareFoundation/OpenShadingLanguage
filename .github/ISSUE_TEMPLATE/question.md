**PLEASE DO NOT ASK USAGE QUESTIONS USING GITHUB "ISSUES"**

If you are pretty sure that you have identified a **BUG** in OSL, please file
a [bug report issue](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenShadingLanguage/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

But if you are just asking a question:
* How do I...?
* I need help with...
* Am I doing something wrong?
* I can't build OSL

For anything of this nature, the best way to get help using OSL is to ask a
question on the [osl-dev developer mail list](https://lists.aswf.io/g/osl-dev).
For quick questions, you could also try the [ASWF Slack](https://slack.aswf.io) `#openshadinglanguage` channel.

Please check the [documentation](https://docs.openshadinglanguage.org) first;
you may find the answer more quickly than you can get your question answered
on the mail list.
